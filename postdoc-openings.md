Thanks for your interest in joining my research group and collaborating with me. I am actively seeking a postdoc through the [iSchool Postdoctoral Research Associate Program](https://ischool.illinois.edu/research/postdoctoral-researchers).

### Guidelines
- The applicant must have **completed requirements for their Ph.D.** prior to **July 1, 2025**. 
- Postdocs are appointed for one year, starting **August 16, 2025**. Progress will be reviewed at the end of year 1 to determine if the candidate will be reappointed for a second year.
- Recipients must be in residence full-time for the duration of the award period.
- In addition to developing their research agendas, iSchool-supported postdocs will demonstrate their teaching readiness by **teaching one course per semester** and they will serve on **at least one service committee**.

### Application
Applications are submitted through an online form: <https://go.ischool.illinois.edu/postdocapplication> 
<br>
The application needs to be submitted before **April 1, 2025**.

### Research Topics

Recently, I am working in the following research areas. Moreover, I am also happy to discuss other potential research topics within the fields of computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

- **Continual learning and few-shot learning:** learning deep neural networks efficiently on limited labeled data and continual data streams. Related papers: [\[Sun et al., 2019\]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Sun_Meta-Transfer_Learning_for_Few-Shot_Learning_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf), [\[Liu et al., 2020\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10211.pdf), [\[Liu et al., 2021\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05063), [\[Liu et al., 2023\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05032), [\[Fischer et al., 2024\]](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~yyliu/preprints/iNeMo_Incremental_Neural_Mesh_Models_for_Robust_Class-Incremental_Learning.pdf), etc.
- **3D generative models**: developing 3D-aware generative models to better understand the underlying 3D structures in 2D images. Related papers: [\[Ma et al., 2023\]](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=XlkN11Xj6J), [\[Fischer et al., 2024\]](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~yyliu/preprints/iNeMo_Incremental_Neural_Mesh_Models_for_Robust_Class-Incremental_Learning.pdf), [\[Ma et al., 2024\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09613), etc.
